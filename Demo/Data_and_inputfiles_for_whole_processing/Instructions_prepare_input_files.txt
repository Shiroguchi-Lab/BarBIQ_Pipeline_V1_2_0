(1) The instruction for preparation of the BarBIQ_example_inputfile_1.txt

Column:	Instruction
Index:	The index ID used in the MiSeq run.
I1_file: The file name of the fastq data of the read I1. 
R1_file: The file name of the fastq data of the read R1. 
R2_file: The file name of the fastq data of the read R2. 
SampleType: Use "Sample" for the real samples, "Blank" for the controls (empty tube to control the contamination), and "SpikeIn" for the co-sequenced spike-in control (to maintain the heterogeneity of the DNA sequences in the library for the sequencing).

(2) The instruction for preparation of the BarBIQ_example_inputfile_2.txt

Column:	Instruction
Folder:	The folder containing all the data of the MiSeq run.
Index:	The index ID used in the MiSeq run.
SampleType:	Use "Sample" for the real samples and "Blank" for the controls (empty tube to control the contamination). The "SpikeIn" should not be included in this file.	
SampleID:	Set a unique name for all the real sample (use the same name for the multiple measurements of the same real sample) and the controls.	
Repeat:	Use 1, 2, ... for each of the multiple measurements of the same real sample.
Multi-seq-detect: Use "Yes" or "No" to mention if use this "Sample" to detect multiple 16S rRNA sequences (Bar sequences) from the same cell. Set "No" for all the "Blank".	
Control:	The "Sample" and their "Blank" should be labeled the same label (e.g., 1, 2, ...). 
Total-conc(copies/mg):	The total abundance of the "Sample" determined using ddPCR. Using "*" for the "Blank".	
Total-conc-SD:	The SD of the determined total abundance of the "Sample". Using "*" for the "Blank".
